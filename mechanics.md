# Game Mechanics Advanced Game Design

## Chapter 1 - Designing Game Mechanics

Game mechanics define how play progresses, what happens when, what determine victory or defeat.

Games should be unpredictable.
- Chance, a way of creating unpredictable outcomes, useful in short games, eg: Blackjack
- Choices made by players, eg: Rock, paper, scissors
- Complex rules, The behavior of individual parts might be simple, but complex when combined, eg: Chess

Rules and mechanics are related, but mechanics are more detailed and concrete.

Core mechanics affects many aspects of the game, eg: gravity.

### Five different types of game mechanics:

- Physics, the science of motion and force
- Internal economy, transactions of game elements, that are collected, consumed, and traded
- Progression mechanisms, how a player move through the world
- Tactical maneuvering, what type of advantages, each unit may gain from being in a possible location. eg: chess
- Social interaction, involves online games

### Game genres:

- Action: detailed physics, power-ups, collectibles, levels
- Strategy: Simple physics, unit building, resource harvesting, upgrades, risking units, scenarios to provide challenges, positioning of units for strategic advantages, coordinated actions, alliances
- Role-playing: Simple physics, turn based, Equipment, experience, story-line quests, party tactics, play-acting
- Sports: Detailed simulation, Team managements, Seasons competitions, tournaments
- Management Siulation: Managing of resources, scenarios, managing of resources
- Adventure: Managing player's inventory, Story to drive the game, locks keys
- Puzzle: Simple, discrete physics, short levels increasing challenges
- Social games..

### Discrete vs. Continuous Mechanics

With discrete rules, it is possible to look-ahead, to plan moves, and create strategies. Offer more innovation.

### The Game Design Process

Concept Stage

Decide game's general idea, the target audience, and player's role. Proof of concept prototype

Elaboration Stage

Game mechanics, levels, story, art assets. Short iterative cycles, to produce a playable product that is tested before the design can move on.

Tuning Stage

Feature freeze, focus on polishing, a subtractive phase.


## Prototyping Techniques


A vertical slice is a prototype that includes all the elements that are required to implement one feature of a game. A horizontal slice is a prototype that includes all parts of some aspect of the game but none of the others.

### Prototype Focus

- Tech demos, prototype the workflow of the technology.

- Game economy, is the game balanced, is there a dominant strategy, do players have interesting choices.

- Interface and controls, can players perform the actions you offer them, are there other actions they want or need? Are you giving information to make the right decisions. Do they notice they are taking damage or some state change.

- Tutorials, in later stages of development. Do players understand how to play the game.
